# JavaScript and Classes

##3 Does JavaScript has classes?

 Yes JavaScript has classes. This feature was introduced with ECMAScript 2015 specification. However, it's important to note that JavaScript is primarily a prototype-based language, and it's classes are primarily syntactical sugar over the existing prototype-based inheritance mechanisms. In other words it provides a more familiar syntax for developers coming from class-based language like Java and C++, but under the hood it works somewhat differently

## Introduction

Understanding data structures and algorithms is fundamental to computer science and software development. This repository is a collection of implementations for various data structures and sorting algorithms, designed to help you grasp the underlying concepts and provide reference implementations in different programming languages.

## Data Structures

### Linked List

The linked list is a linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes, and each node points to the next in the sequence. Check out the linked list implementations in the `linked-list` directory.

### Stack

A stack is a last-in, first-out (LIFO) data structure. Explore the stack implementations in the `stack` directory.

### Queue

A queue is a first-in, first-out (FIFO) data structure. Discover the queue implementations in the `queue` directory.

### Trees

Tree structures are hierarchical and widely used in computer science. Explore tree data structures in the `trees` directory.

### AVL Trees

AVL trees are self-balancing binary search trees, ensuring logarithmic height. Dive into the `avl-trees` directory for AVL tree implementations.

### Graphs

Graphs consist of nodes and edges, forming a network of connections. Discover graph implementations in the `graphs` directory.

## Sorting Algorithms

### Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. Explore Bubble Sort in the `sorting-algorithms` directory.

### Selection Sort

Selection Sort sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part and putting it at the beginning. Find the Selection Sort implementation in the `sorting-algorithms` directory.

### Insertion Sort

Insertion Sort builds the sorted array one item at a time by repeatedly taking elements from the unsorted part and inserting them into their correct position. Check out Insertion Sort in the `sorting-algorithms` directory.

### Merge Sort

Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the array into two halves, sorts each half, and then merges them. Explore Merge Sort in the `sorting-algorithms` directory.

### Quick Sort

Quick Sort is another efficient divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that partitions the array into smaller segments and recursively sorts them. Find Quick Sort in the `sorting-algorithms` directory.

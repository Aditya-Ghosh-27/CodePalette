Shell Programming Theory

Standard Practises is to write the lower line at first of any shell program
#! /bin/bash

#! is known as "hashbang" followed by the location of the shell (which we get using the command "which bash" - gives the location of the bash executable file)

echo command is used to print what we write in the "" 

There are 2 ways to execute a shell file
1. sh hello.sh  (Output: Hello World)
2. ./hello.sh (Output: Hello World)
